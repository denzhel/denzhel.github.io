If you are not familiar with ngrok … BEHOLD !

Basically it’s a small utility that exposes your local server to the outside world by providing you a public address. 

All you have to do is run the command:
```shell
ngrok <proto> <port>
e.g
ngrok http 4231
```

Output:
```shell

```

In this example, I expose aNodeJS app on my laptop to the outside world. 

That way Github can send me a notification(to http://37718a48.ngrok.io) through the repos web hook once a PR was approved.

You can download it from:
```
https://ngrok.com
```

OR simply install it on your mac:
```
brew cask install ngrok
```
